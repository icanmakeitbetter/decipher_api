Here’s a bit more detail about the community.&nbsp;What is this all about? &nbsp;In the community, you’ll have an exclusive opportunity to get your voice heard and help shape the future of Quick Service Restaurants. There will be regular forum discussions in the community to get involved in about a wide range of topics for the next 12 months. These activities can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes of your time each week. &nbsp;What will you have to do? There will be weekly discussions on a wide range of topics, as well as a variety of ‘special projects’ such as regular quick surveys, polls, and Skype interviews. The special projects will be a bit more involved and will help us get to know you and understand your views whereas the polls and surveys will be really quick, easy and won’t take up much of your time. All the projects will be interesting and hopefully a lot of fun for you to get involved with! &nbsp;What’s in it for you? &nbsp;As a thank you for participating in activities, you’ll earn Tango gift cards for the activities you complete. These gift cards will range in value between $5 and $100, and you’ll receive these about a week after completing each activity.
